==About

This was written again Wordpress 2.7 and I'm not sure if it will work with older versions.

Pretty portfolio is a simple plugin which takes blog posts in a certain category and builds a nice
jQuery enabled portfolio sliding widget. It has the same effect as Panic.com's CODA -- or a carousel,
whichever you prefer.

==Install

copy the pretty_portfolio to wp-content/plugins and enable it from the wordpress admin panel

cd wp-content/plugins
git clone git://github.com/robhurring/pretty_portfolio.git

==Setup
