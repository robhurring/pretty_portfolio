==About

This was written again Wordpress 2.7 and I'm not sure if it will work with older versions.

Pretty portfolio is a simple plugin which takes blog posts in a certain category and builds a nice
jQuery enabled portfolio sliding widget. It has the same effect as Panic.com's CODA -- or a carousel,
whichever you prefer.

==Install

copy the pretty_portfolio to wp-content/plugins and enable it from the wordpress admin panel

this plugin will include all the necessary jQuery files. If you use a custom jQuery file, you might
want to muck around in the pretty_portfolio.php code and comment out the line stating "wp_deregister_script('jquery');"

cd wp-content/plugins
git clone git://github.com/robhurring/pretty_portfolio.git

==Setup

This setup is a bit tricky but not too difficult for someone (un?)familiar with Wordpress.

===Configure the Plugin

1) Activate the plugin from the Wordpress admin panel

2) Under "Settings" a new Pretty Portfolio menu will appear.

3) Under the PP Settings it wants to know which Category you want to observe. To get this ID edit the category you
		wish to use and take note of the URL. In the case of "categories.php?action=edit&cat_ID=3" we would put 3 into
		the PP setting "portfolio category ID"

===Setup our Page Template

We must copy the page template to our theme's directory so we can display our new portfolio stuff.

4) Copy the "plugins/pretty_portfolio/template_pretty_portfolio.php" file to your theme's folder. We must assign this
		template to the appropriate page you want now.
		
5) Create/Edit the page you wish to use as your portfolio. Make sure to assign the "Pretty Portfolio" template to it.
		(Should be an option on the right-hand sidebar) Not much else matters on this page except the Title. The content
		will not be shown by default (Let me know if you'd like the page content to appear above the slider).
		
6) Now we are ready to start populating the portfolio.

==How to add a portfolio piece

1) Create a new Post.

2) Check off the Pretty Portfolio Category ID (in our example we would use category 3, which I have as "portfolio")

3) Fill in the Excerpt. This is what will show up as the blurb on our slider.

4) Open up the "Pretty Portfolio" panel which should be near the bottom of the page underneath the Excerpt panel.

5) Fill out the Fields.
	(All of these are optional.. but you should probably enter at least 1 :)
	
	a) Big portfolio image: the image to display on the slider as a preview 
	b) Big image preview: the bigger version to pop open when the image is clicked
	c) Client name: really not sure about this one :)
	d) What skills were used: Just a simple text of what you've done.
	e) Link to client's website: if you want to throw a link to their site out there.
	
6) Publish.

==Customizing the plugin's appearance

You can find all the necessary CSS styles in the plugins/pretty_portfolio/css/pretty_portfolio.css file

You can modify the layout by editing the plugins/pretty_portfolio/template_pretty_portfolio.php file. Just make
sure you copy this back to your theme's directory after modifying (Or modify in place through the theme editor).
